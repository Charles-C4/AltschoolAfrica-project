    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hey there! My name is Chigaemezu charles chukwuleta, and I have a deep passion for <i>, creativity, and building things that matter</i>.
        Since childhood, I have always been intrigued by how digital tools can shape the world. 
        From tinkering with gadgets to attempting my first lines of code, I realized that problem-solving through software excites me the most. 
        Now, I’m taking this passion seriously at "AltSchool Africa's School of Engineering" to turn it into a full-fledged career.
